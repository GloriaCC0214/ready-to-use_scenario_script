Data filtering
 -DNBSEQ data
  -remove reads with a certain proportion of low quality (â‰¤20) bases (40% as default) and of Ns (10% as default)
  -remove adapter and duplication contamination
 -PacBio Sequel II data
  -extract Subreads from Polymerase Reads
  -filter out adapter sequences
  -exclude Subreads less than 1,000 bp

Genome assembly
 -Subreads correction
  -Canu and Falcon were used to obtain highly reliable corrected reads
 -Corrected reads assembly
  -Canu and Falcon were employed respectively to acquire the best assembly result ultimately
 -Correction of assembly result
  -GATK was utilized to perform single-base corrections with second-generation sequencing data
 -Judgment for sequence loop
 -Discrimination between chromosome and plasmid sequence
