-For DNBSEQ data
 -remove reads with a certain proportion of low quality (â‰¤20) bases (40% as default) and of Ns (0.1% as default)
 -remove adapter and duplication contamination
-For PacBio Sequel II data
 -subreads were extracted from polymerase reads
 -subreads less than 1,000 bp were excluded
 -highly accurate circular consensus sequencing (CCS) data was obtained from subreads by SMRT Analysis

-For genome assembly
 -subreads correction
  -Canu and Falcon were used to obtain highly reliable corrected reads
 -corrected reads assembly
  -Canu and Falcon were employed respectively to acquire the best assembly result ultimately
 -correction of assembly result
  -GATK was utilized to perform single-base corrections with second-generation sequencing data, enhancing the reliability of the assembly sequence
 -judgment for sequence loop
 -discrimination between chromosome and plasmid sequence
